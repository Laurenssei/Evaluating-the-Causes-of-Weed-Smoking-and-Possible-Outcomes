## Overview
This project explores the prevalence, causes, and consequences of weed smoking in Anfoega, North Dayi District, Ghana, amid growing community concerns about its impact on public health and social dynamics. Drawing from primary survey data collected in 2025, the study analyzes trends in usage, underlying drivers, negative outcomes, and potential mitigation strategies. By examining demographic patterns and community perceptions, the research highlights the role of social influences and availability in perpetuating weed use. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to promote healthier behaviors and sustainable community development. This analysis contributes to evidence-based approaches for addressing substance use in rural settings, informing policymakers, educators, and local leaders.

## Dataset Summary
- **Source**: Primary survey data collected in Anfoega, North Dayi District, Ghana (2025).
- **Sample Size**: 406 respondents.
- **Key Variables**: Demographics (age, gender, education, employment, residence length); weed usage behaviors (ever used, age at first use, frequency, sources); causes (reasons, influences, availability); outcomes (health, social, financial, legal impacts); community perceptions (trends, stigma, strategies).

## Objectives
- Examine trends in weed smoking prevalence and patterns in Anfoega.
- Identify the major causes and influencing factors behind weed smoking.
- Evaluate the negative health, social, financial, and legal effects of weed smoking.
- Explore innovative strategies to reduce weed smoking prevalence in the community.



## Methods
- Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, and cross-tabulations for demographic profiles and key variables.
- Inferential analysis using Chi-square tests for associations and logistic regression for predictors of weed use.
- Text mining and word clouds for open-ended responses on factors and strategies.
- Visualizations generated via R Markdown, including bar charts, tables, and summary plots.

## Key Findings
- Weed smoking prevalence stands at 38.7%, with 82.8% of users perceiving a significant increase over the past five years, driven primarily by increased availability and peer pressure.
- Curiosity (45.2%), stress relief (31.8%), and peer pressure (22.9%) emerge as leading causes, with friends as the dominant influence and source of weed.
- Most users report no major negative effects (72% no health issues, 84.1% no social or financial impacts), though 28% note cognitive impairments like reduced concentration, amid high community stigma (55.5%).
- Community supports awareness campaigns (37.1%) and stricter law enforcement (25.4%) as key strategies, with peer mentorship and family-led efforts favored for youth discouragement.
